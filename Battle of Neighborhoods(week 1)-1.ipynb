    "I am a data scientist currently residing in Downtown Singapore. I currently live within walking distance to Downtown \"Telok Ayer MRT metro station\" therefore I have access to good public transportation to work. Likewise, I enjoy many ammenities in the neighborhood , such as international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work in Manhattan, NY. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stress toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Manhattan. Therefore, I decided to apply the learned skills during the Coursera course to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it rewarding doing it myself with learned tools."

    "I believe this is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to a major city in Europe, US or Asia, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills."
